# text-modeling-system
This file includes the following components: 

Part I: Building an initial text model <br>
Part II: Saving and retrieving a text model <br>
Part III: Adding features to the model <br>
Part IV: Adding a Bayesian scoring algorithm <br>
Part V: Comparing Texts 

Specifically, I fed the initial text model articles from GQ and Cosmo so the model would begin to recognize each magazine's writing. I then ran additional articles from GQ and Cosmo through the model (articles that it had not yet seen) to test its accuracy - whether it correctly ranked those articles as being more similar to their correct publication. For fun, I ran articles from other publications as well as my own writing through the model to see which publication - GQ or Cosmo - the model scored the writing as being more similar to.
